1) TIME_TO_WAIT_INVADERS changed from 500ms to 100ms

2) New state "NEXT_LEVEL" added (not yet implemented)

3) ResetShip() function added so if hit ship will go to left corner and SI won't be restored.

4) Pressing key "3" will toggle between single and 3-bullet fire. (must be level 3 at least?????)
