This code should help:

// create our CDX objects
CDXScreen *screen;
CDXSurface *surface;
CDXResource *res;

// create our screen
screen = new CDXScreen();

// create our resource object
res = new CDXResource();

// open a resource file
res->Open("MYRES.WAD");

// create a CDXSurface from a bitmap resource in the file
surface = new CDXSurface(screen, res->GetFile("MYBITMAP.BMP"),
CDXMEM_VIDTHENSYS);

// draw the new surface to the screen and flip
screen->GetBack()->Draw(surface);
screen->Flip();

The drawback is that CDXResource kinda sucks. It writes out a temporary file
called
CDX.TMP each time you call GetFile so it's a bit of a hog if you have large
files
you're extracting. CDXResource needs someone to look after it and make it a
little
better but it does the job. It would be nice if someone fixed it up to load the
files directly in memory but since CDX uses disk files, what's the point? Also,
the resouce builder program isn't very good in that it needs to be able to open
resource files and move things around in them. A good weekend project for
someone.
